 * Weak reference.
 *
 * A weak reference is a pointer to a reference counter in which the
 * least-significant bit is used to indicate whether the counter is
 * "dying", i.e. about to be destroyed.
 *
 * It must be accessed with atomic instructions. There is no need to
 * enforce memory order on access since the only data that depends on
 * the weak reference are cpu-local deltas.
