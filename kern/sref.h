 * Scalable reference counting.
 *
 * The purpose of this module is to reduce the amount of inter-processor
 * communication usually involved with reference counting. Scalable
 * reference counters should only be used when multiprocessor scalability
 * is important because of the costs they imply (increased memory usage
 * and latencies).
 *
 * When a counter drops to 0, the no-reference function associated with it
 * is called in work context. As a result, special care must be taken if
 * using sref counters in the work module itself.
