   * Enabling application processors is done late in the boot process for
   * two reasons :
   *  - It's much simpler to bootstrap with interrupts disabled on all
   *    processors, enabling them only when necessary on the BSP.
   *  - Depending on the architecture, the pmap module could create per
   *    processor page tables. Once done, keeping the kernel page tables
   *    synchronized requires interrupts (and potentially scheduling)
   *    enabled on all processors.
   *
   * It is highly recommended not to do anything else than starting the
   * scheduler right after this call.
