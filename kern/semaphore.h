 *
 * Semaphores are resource-counting sleeping synchronization objects.
 * They are used to synchronize access to resources and signal events.
 *
 * The main operations supported by semaphores are waiting and signalling.
 * A semaphore is implemented as a counter with an initial value. Waiting
 * on a semaphore means decrementing that counter, whereas signalling
 * means incrementing it. Waiting can only succeed if the semaphore value
 * is strictly greater than 0.
 *
 * The use of semaphores is generally discouraged. Mutexes are recommended
 * to implement preemptible critical sections, and spinlocks combined with
 * calls to thread_sleep() and thread_wakeup() are recommended for
 * non-preemptible critical sections. The reason is that a semaphore
 * internally already uses a spinlock, but that internal lock may not be
 * used to serialize access to anything else. This means that the only case
 * where a semaphore may be an efficient synchronization mechanism is
 * real-time signalling, e.g. an interrupt handler signalling a thread.
 * Here, "real-time" means that there is a guarantee that the thread has
 * always consumed the data produced by the interrupt handler before the
 * latter runs again.
 *
 * Since the kernel is an incomplete program without applications, it is
 * impossible to perform an analysis providing the real-time guarantee.
 * As a result, semaphores may only be used by application code.
