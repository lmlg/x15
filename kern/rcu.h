 * operations, best used on read-mostly data structures.
 *
 * To learn more about RCU, see "Is Parallel Programming Hard, And, If So,
 * What Can You Do About It ?" by Paul E. McKenney.
 *
 * A thorough discussion of RCU's requirements can be found at [1].
 * However, the memory model and terminology used in that document being
 * different from C11, the memory barrier guarantees are hereby translated
 * into memory ordering guarantees :
 *
 *  1. Release-acquire ordering is enforced between the end of all
 *     read-side critical sections starting before a grace period starts
 *     and the start of all works deferred before the same grace period
 *     starts.
 *  2. Release-acquire ordering is enforced between the start of all
 *     read-side critical sections ending after a grace period ends
 *     and all the work deferrals done before the same grace period
 *     starts.
 *  3. Release-acquire ordering is enforced between all the work deferrals
 *     done before a grace period starts and the start of all works deferred
 *     before the same grace period starts.
