 * Per-thread performance monitoring counter.
 *
 * Per-thread PMCs are indexed the same way as global PMCs.
 *
 * A per-thread PMC is referenced when an event is attached to a thread.
 * The PMC may only be loaded if the thread is running on a processor,
 * as a result of an event being attached to the thread, or the thread
 * being dispatched by the scheduler. Note that this allows a transient
 * state to be seen where a per-thread PMC is both unused and loaded.
 * This happens after detaching an event from a thread, resulting in
 * the underlying per-thread PMC to become unused, but if the thread
 * is running concurrently, the counter is still loaded. The implementation
 * resolves the situation by unloading the counter, which is either
 * done by an explicit unload cross-call, or when the scheduler preempts
 * the thread and unloads its thread data.
 *
 * When a per-thread PMC is loaded, the current value of the underlying
 * PMC is saved, and when it's updated, the delta between the current
 * and saved PMC values is added to the per-thread PMC value.
