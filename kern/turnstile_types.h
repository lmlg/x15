 * Per-thread turnstile data.
 *
 * The turnstile member indicates whether this thread is in a turnstile,
 * and is only valid if the thread is not running.
 *
 * The waiter points to the structure a thread uses to queue itself on
 * a turnstile. It is used to access a sleeping thread from another
 * thread, e.g. on wake-ups or priority updates.
 *
 * The list of owned turnstiles is used by priority propagation to
 * determine the top priority among all waiters, which is stored in
 * the thread data so that turnstiles are quickly unlocked.
 *
 * Locking keys :
 * (b) bucket
 * (t) turnstile_td
